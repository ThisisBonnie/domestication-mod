Because I need to write this shit down or else I'll lose track of how the hell this shit works.

Affini country:
  floret_index - index to assign to next Affini/floret pair

Affini leader:
  floret_count - number of florets (total, ever) this leader has had
  affini_id_1 - ID for Affini/floret pair
  affini_id_2 - same, but for 2nd active floret
  bloom_number - so and so, Nth Bloom
  bloom_initialized - flag for if the bloom structure has been set up
  bloom_id - ID for leader/clone pair

Floret 'leader':
  floret_number - ", 1st Floret"
  floret_id - ID for Affini/floret pair

Leader 'clone':
  bloom_id - ID for leader/clone pair



  if = {
    limit = {
      leader_class = scientist
    }
    global_event_target:bloom_country = {
      create_leader = {
        name = "[root.GetName]"
        species = root
        class = scientist
        set_age = 0
        skill = 1
      }
    }
  }
